#Choropleth Map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded in proportion to a statististical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristics within each area, such as population density or GDP

#After importing related libraries we initialize notebook mode and then create a dictionary data object and layout object

#First we need to create a data dictionary because plotly only accepts certain types of data
